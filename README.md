Density Dependent MSE for blue whiting and mackerel

Part of project "117957 Fmsy-project for six high profile fish stocks", coordinated by the University of Copenhagen. 

Aim is to develop age-based (shortcut) MSE models for blue whiting and mackerel, where density dependent growth, maturity, and natural mortality is included. Four alternative MSEs will be used and the results will be compared to the most recent ICES used MSE.
